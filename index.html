  <p>We talked about the sonority hierarchy in relation to the nonce word judgments. Sonority is an acoustic property of speech sounds, and a sonority hierarchy ranks speech sounds with respect to their sonority (see Figure 1). The sonority hierarchy plays an important role in how syllables are built in languages. The materials for the nonce word experiment were taken from Daland et al. (2011).</p>

  <p>The sentences are island constructions, and the name comes from Ross (1967). Islands are syntactic structures that seal off the elements inside them, and thus <i>extraction</i> (we called this movement) out of them results in decreased, sometimes complete, acceptability. The island data is from Sprouse, Wagers & Phillips (2011).</p>
  <p>Why did I show you these examples? I wanted to show you some instances of grammar, what we call the set of rules combining basic expressions of language, in action. The judgments come to you very easily, as they do to other speakers of English and many other languages, but it is not easy to pinpoint why you have the judgments you have. I chose fairly complex phenomena on purpose to highlight the fact that the rules are <i>unconscious</i>, and the generalizations we make are not straightforward.</p>
